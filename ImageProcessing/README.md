The file, baseline-feature.mat, contains three variables that describe all 3060 images in the dataset:

imageClass: classification. 1 by 3060

psix: feature mapping using VL algorithm. 1200 by 3060. Every row is a feature.

hists: spatial histogram. 3600 by 3060 (not needed for midway report but can be processed)

For all variables, every column stands for one image.
